# ggplot1

ggplot1 is update of ggplot, the package that preceded ggplot2. ggplot1 is mostly made available out of historical interest, to illustrate how my thinking about API design in R has evolved over the years.

## Installation

You can install ggplot1 from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ggplot1/hadley")
```
